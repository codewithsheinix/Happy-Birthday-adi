                    Today just felt a little gloomy hahaha and I don't know why but I feel like I'm slipping back to my old habits hahaha maybe this is a sign I'm getting too happy and with that happiness I fear that it may cost me so much hahaha but I don't really care as long as I have you in my life I can get anything done heh so I wrote that first part around morning it's now 8pm at night and Ive don't lost It all so I'm gonna attempt this is gonna be nvm I've lost count on how many times I have attempted suicide but this might be my last letter to you I don't even know if your ever gonna read it or any of my other letters because I'm scared that if I send them hahaha you might think of me differently or even worse your just gonna push me away and I don't want to lose you not now or ever I want to stay by your side forever hahaha I think I'm In love with sheina honestly hahaha but who cares cause if this attempt ever works hahaha no one would ever remember me and you sheina please even if you don't feel me that way don't cry or grieve over me ahhaha I probably deserve it anyway ahhaha just saying that I love you?? I guess hahaha and thanks for the fun times and thankful for destiny that I met you in life hehehe

                    Hahaha writing again because that attempt sucked it didn't even work hahahha now I'm just goofing around like I didn't attempt 3 days earlier I'm stupid like that but anyways hope you have been better and hope life treats you good I know your always tired because you support your own self hahaha that must be super tiring I wish I could be the one you know you can call, text or just be the person you think of and your tiredness will go away but nope that's not me it probably belongs to another man but that's okay because kuya yow said that "if you love a person love them unconditionally, just because you love a person doesn't mean they need to reciprocate that feeling just love them and don't expect anything  in return" and when I heard that hahaha it really hit me where it hurts because yes I love you and all that but that don't mean you reciprocate that feeling and you don't ever have to because I'm just a not a close friend I guess just a classmate to you hehehe anyways that's all for this day hehehe </p>

                    Ahhaha wow that year flew by me so quick I'm stumped I didn't even notice but new year new me? Nah just joking my folks asked me last night if I really love/like you ahhaha and for a few minutes I didn't have an answer for them I just kinda blanked and then our memories together popped into my head and then suddenly without thinking hahaha I just said "love? Like? Hahaha who sheina? If this question is about her then my answer would be yes absolutely without hesitation in my body I know for a fact that I love and like her at the same time because I cant like someone without loving them and I can't love someone without liking them and sheina for me is the scariest yet best thing that ever happened to my life ya know you guys know me best since y'all are my family but if I had to pick between who I'm calling when I'm at my lowest and I need a boost of life then without a second thought I'm calling sheina because she sparks my life in all ways hahaha" and when I answered all of them were kinda just stunned because the mark they knew never showed that type of side but yes if you ever get the chance to read this yes I like you and yes I love you suck to suck getting loved by me</p>

I love how you make me feel safe, how you support me, and how you believe in me even when I doubt myself. You are truly one of a kind, Sheina, and I thank God every day for bringing you into my life.
